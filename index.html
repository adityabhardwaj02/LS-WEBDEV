        Grand Theft Auto V is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the seventh main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV, and the fifteenth instalment overall. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas, based on Southern California, the single-player story follows three protagonists—retired bank robber Michael De Santa, street gangster Franklin Clinton, and drug dealer and gunrunner Trevor Philips—and their attempts to commit heists while under pressure from a corrupt government agency and powerful criminals.

        <span style="color:rgb(16, 95, 7);font-weight: bold; ">Franklin Clinton </span>is a young African-American man who dreams of becoming big-time in Los Santos, in a world where the glory days of street gangs has long passed. He works as a repo man for a luxury car dealership, but his ambition makes him tired of the job.
    Franklin soon strikes up a friendship with Michael, one of his repossession victims, who coincidentally got him fired. He helps the once-successful bank robber, and the two form a strange but close father-son relationship. When they execute a jewelry store heist, they are joined by Michael's ex-partner Trevor Philips. The trio pull off several jobs, and Trevor and Franklin additionally do one job together. Franklin eventually acts as a go-between when Trevor and Michael fall out, however they are able to put their differences aside temporarily to pull off a final heist.</p>

        <span style="color:brown;font-weight: bold; ">Trevor Philips</span> is a mentally unstable redneck and bank robber. A former military pilot, he based himself in Sandy Shores, where he founded "Trevor Philips Enterprises", which mainly deals with weapons and drugs. After learning of the jewelry store heist in Los Santos, Trevor realises that his supposedly deceased partner Michael is alive and well, and sets out to find him. After finding his old friend in Los Santos, the two, aided by Franklin Clinton, are forced to pull off jobs for corrupt FIB agent Steve Haines. Trevor soon discovers that Michael had betrayed him nine years ago, and the two have a bitter falling out. Fortunately, they manage to put their differences aside in order to pull off a final heist.

        <span style="color:rgb(64, 12, 147);font-weight: bold; ">Michael De Santa</span>, formerly Michael Townley, is a retired bank robber, who, after making a deal with the Federal Investigation Bureau, moves alongside his family to Los Santos, where they live in a nice mansion. Unfortunately, his wife, Amanda, repeatedly spends his money and the family has became largely dysfunctional over the years. After getting on the wrong side of a Mexican Cartel leader, Michael is forced to return to criminal life once more, this time, aided by his protege and up-and-coming criminal Franklin Clinton. After his first job, he is joined by former friend Trevor Philips. Despite a rift in their friendship after several jobs, including stealing a superweapon from the government, raiding a county bank & a research lab for the FIB, they banded together with Franklin and Lester to pull off a final heist.

        Getting started in GTA V is easy. The game starts you off with the tutorial mission, Prologue, which introduces you to the main characters, Michael De Santa and Trevor Philips. The tutorial is very helpful in showing you how to move your characters, access and aim your weapons, interact with items and NPCs, and switch between characters.<br>
        While the Prologue mission will show you how to switch between characters, it is important to know that you will be frequently switching between Michael, Trevor, and Franklin Clinton in order to progress through the main story.
